# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.


## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-scikit-learn-extension/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-scikit-learn-extension/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20), issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment


## Contributing via Pull Requests
Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *master* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

### Pulling Down the Code

1. If you do not already have one, create a GitHub account by following the prompts at [Join Github](https://github.com/join).
1. Create a fork of this repository on GitHub. You should end up with a fork at `https://github.com/<username>/sagemaker-scikit-learn-extension`.
   1. Follow the instructions at [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) to fork a GitHub repository.
1. Clone your fork of the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/sagemaker-scikit-learn-extension` where `<username>` is your github username.


### Running the Unit Tests

1. Install conda or miniconda if you have not already done so. See [conda/miniconda installation instructions.](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
1. Install test dependencies using `pip install .[test]` (or, for Zsh users: `pip install .\[test\]`)
1. cd into the sagemaker-scikit-learn-extension folder: `cd sagemaker-scikit-learn-extension` or `cd /environment/sagemaker-scikit-learn-extension`
1. Run the following tox command and verify that all code checks and unit tests pass: `tox`
   1. Note that this will run unit tests, linting tests, package tests, and automatically formatting tests.

You can also run a single test with the following command: `tox -e py37 -- -s -vv <path_to_file><file_name>::<test_function_name>`  
  * Note that the coverage test will fail if you only run a single test, so make sure to surround the command with `export IGNORE_COVERAGE=-` and `unset IGNORE_COVERAGE`
  * Example: `export IGNORE_COVERAGE=- ; tox -e py37 -- -s -vv tests/test_impute.py::test_robust_imputer ; unset IGNORE_COVERAGE`


### Making and Testing Your Change

1. Create a new git branch:
     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```
1. Make your changes, **including unit tests**.
   1. Include unit tests when you contribute new features or make bug fixes, as they help to:
      1. Prove that your code works correctly.
      1. Guard against future breaking changes to lower the maintenance cost.
   1. Please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
1. Run all the unit tests as per [Running the Unit Tests](#running-the-unit-tests), and verify that all checks and tests pass.
   1. Note that this also runs tools that may be necessary for the automated build to pass (ex: code reformatting by 'black').  


### Committing Your Change

We use commit messages to update the project version number and generate changelog entries, so it's important for them to follow the right format. Valid commit messages include a prefix, separated from the rest of the message by a colon and a space. Here are a few examples:

```
feature: support sparse inputs for RobustStandardScaler
fix: fix flake8 errors
```

Valid prefixes are listed in the table below.

| Prefix          | Use for...                                                                                     |
|----------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `breaking`      | Incompatible API changes.                                                                      |
| `deprecation`   | Deprecating an existing API or feature, or removing something that was previously deprecated.  |
| `feature`       | Adding a new feature.                                                                          |
| `fix`           | Bug fixes.                                                                                     |
| `change`        | Any other code change.                                                                         |
| `documentation` | Documentation changes.                                                                         |

Some of the prefixes allow abbreviation ; `break`, `feat`, `depr`, and `doc` are all valid. If you omit a prefix, the commit will be treated as a `change`.

For the rest of the message, use imperative style and keep things concise but informative. See [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for guidance.


### Sending a Pull Request

GitHub provides additional document on [Creating a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

Please remember to:
* Use commit messages (and PR titles) that follow the guidelines under [Committing Your Change](#committing-your-change).
* Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
* Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.


## Finding contributions to work on
Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any ['help wanted'](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-scikit-learn-extension/labels/help%20wanted) issues is a great place to start.
